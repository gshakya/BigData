Given a text-file input123,
1. The program will extract each "word" and form a key-value pair 
where the key is the "word" and value is integer one.  Note that your program 
should treat Cat and cat as the same word.
2. Each pair is inserted into a List. 3. Sort the List using "Collections". 
This may involve writing a comparator for the pair class.
4. Output the List
5. Note that tokens such as input123, abc.txt,  
a23bc and abc_ptr  are not words. However, key-value is two words.
